# Project Systeem 3C

Repository for the class from the Hogeschool Utrecht.
code is writen by Ruben Middelman but owned by the HU University of Applied Sciences Utrecht.

For this project the excersice was to get more people to excersise in lockdown.

To get more people to move the idea was to set up a timer for a tv.
if the timer goes off the TV will turn of and it is only possible to turn it back on by excersising.

## documetation
this course requierd me to do research about GUI. I wrote a paper about it (in dutch sorry) that has also been added to the repository.
