# How to use the code
connect the servo's of the delta-robot to an arduino as seen on the schematic in the drive
then connect the arduino via a cable to a laptop or pc and upload the .ino code
then run the python code on your laptop or pc (it will work if you have all the libraries installed)
if you did everything right it should work by typing 0 into the interface
